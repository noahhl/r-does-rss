<h1>r-does-rss: an ultra lightweight RSS reader for R</h1>

r-does-rss is an incredibly lightweight RSS reader for the <a href="http://www.R-project.org/"> R statistical programming language </a>. It will parse RSS and Atom feeds and return a named list consisting of header information and a list of items. The specific contents of the items will vary based on the specification of the feed used.

To use, simply source rss.R (package creation pending). Then, use getFeed(feed, auth) to get your feed. Auth is optional, and if used should be a single text string representing basic http-authenticated (in the form username:password).

An sample usage is provided in rss_example.R. This example gets the Atom feed from <a href="http://crantastic.org">Crantastic.org</a> and the RSS feed from <a href="http://www.r-bloggers.com">R-bloggers.com</a> and prints updates since you last opened R (if unable to determine when you last opened R, prints updates from the last week). Try adding this to your .Rprofile!
