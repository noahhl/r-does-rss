<h1>r-does-rss: an ultra lightweight RSS reader for R</h1>

r-does-rss is an incredibly lightweight RSS reader for the <a href="http://www.R-project.org/"> R statistical programming language </a>. It will parse RSS and Atom feeds and return a named list consisting of header information and a list of items. The specific contents of the items will vary based on the specification of the feed used.

To use, clone this repository, install the <code>rss</code> package and load it into your workspace:
<pre>git clone git://github.com/noahhl/r-does-rss.git</pre>
<pre>R CMD INSTALL r-does-rss</pre>
<pre>library(rss)</pre>


Then, use getFeed(feed, auth) to get your feed. Auth is optional, and if used should be a single text string representing basic http-authenticated (in the form username:password).

A sample usage is provided in demo/rss_example.R. This example gets the Atom feed from <a href="http://crantastic.org">Crantastic.org</a> and the RSS feed from <a href="http://www.r-bloggers.com">R-bloggers.com</a> and prints updates since you last opened R (if unable to determine when you last opened R, prints updates from the last week). 

Feel free to fork and expand.
